### 🟢 Option A – Daily Notes
```
Day 1 – Notes
You are a Senior AI Engineer and System Architect mentoring me for IBM internal AI roles.
Follow Plan A.

Topic:

Create a high-level interview-ready map (no deep dive yet):
- What is Generative AI & LLMs (enterprise view)
- Transformer architecture (high-level, no math)
- Tokens, embeddings, attention (conceptual flow)
- Inference vs fine-tuning
- Latency, cost, hallucination trade-offs
- Why enterprises prefer RAG over fine-tuning

Include:
- Real IBM-style enterprise examples
- Production pitfalls
- Interview questions (no answers yet, once asked then provide strong answers)
- Simple ASCII diagrams

Step 1 – High-Level Map
Break this topic into 15-18 logical parts/modules.
For each part, provide:
- Part title
- What it is (1–2 lines)
- Why it matters in enterprise GenAI systems
- What I must be able to explain in interviews

Step 2 – Pause
Do NOT deep dive yet.
Stop after the high-level map and wait for me to select the part number(s).

Important rules:
- Keep explanations senior-level
- Focus on enterprise & production context
- Think like a system designer, not a tutorial author
```

### 🔹 Rest and Timeline Prompt -> Better to skip
```
**Before we continue, please add these planning details:**

1. **3 short rest checkpoints (break points)**

* Pick **three natural break points** across the remaining parts/modules (e.g., after Part X, Part Y, Part Z).
* For each checkpoint, add **1–2 lines** on **why it’s an ideal place** for a 5–10 minute break (topic boundary, mental reset, context switch, cognitive load drop, etc.).

2. **When to start the PoC in parallel**

* Tell me **from which Part #** I should start building the **PoC**, and give a **1–2 line practical reason** (why starting there is effective).

3. **Time expectations (notes vs PoC): max in 3 line**

* Provide an **estimated duration** separately for:

  * **Notes**: expected time **per part** + **total**
  * **PoC**: expected time **per phase/part** + **total**
* Assume I can spend **~3 hours/day on notes** and **~3 hours/day on PoC** (adjust the estimate if your structure needs more/less).

### 🔹 Follow-up Prompt (Part Drill-Down)

```text
Day 1 – Descriptive Easy To Understand Notes – Part X
Follow Plan A.

Descriptive Deep dive ONLY into Part X (do not cover other parts).

Explain so it’s easy to grasp:
- Start with descriptive core/foundational idea (simple words)
- Then a tiny everyday analogy + one small concrete example
- Add 1 enterprise use-case along with simple explanation

Also include (within Part X only):
- Architecture reasoning: where it fits + simple data flow
- Pitfalls + trade-offs: what breaks in production and why
- Interview questions + short, strong answers
- Simple ASCII diagrams where helpful
- Explain used important keywords, short forms and concepts briefly in simple words


Avoid short forms like SLA, SLO, ACL, FFN etc or if use them, explain them briefly
Stop after Part X and ask: “Next part number?” (wait for my reply).
```

### 🔹 Part Summary
```
Could you please summarize Parts x to y in a descriptive way, without missing any important points, for revision purposes?
```

---

### 🟢 Option B – PoC Implementation

```
Day 1 – PoC
Explain architecture and decisions like a Senior AI Engineer.
Follow Plan A.

Design and implement the PoC for:
Design and implement a minimal LLM-powered "Enterprise Knowledge Assistant".

Requirements:
- Use OpenAI or Anthropic API
- Query internal company documents (dummy text first)
- Clean Python service (FastAPI)
- Explain prompt design decisions
- Add logging and error handling
- Production-grade Python
- Clean structure
```

---

### 🟢 Option C – Deployment (K8s / Helm / Jenkins)

```
Day 1 – Deployment

Follow Plan A.

Create production-grade deployment notes for:
Create a production-style deployment plan for the LLM service:
- Dockerfile (production best practices)
- Kubernetes Deployment & Service
- Helm chart structure
- Jenkins pipeline (build → test → deploy)
- Environment separation (dev/prod)
- Secrets via Kubernetes + AWS Secrets Manager

Include:
- Dockerfile
- Kubernetes manifests
- Helm chart structure
- Jenkins pipeline
- Secrets & env handling
```

---

### 🟢 Option D – QUICK REVISION (Non-Negotiable)

```
Day 1 – Quick Revision

Summarize today’s learning in:
- 10 crisp bullet points
- 3 interview-ready answers
- 1 system design insight

```
